# C-ALINEA â€“ Coordinated Control Algorithm For Fairness In Ramp Metering

## Introduction
This repository contains a Python implementation of a traffic microsimulation to demonstrate the potential of **C-ALINEA**, a coordinated ramp metering controller designed to improve fairness by considering neighboring ramps in addition to the controlled ramp. The repository is based on [SUMO (provided by DLR)](https://sumo.dlr.de).
